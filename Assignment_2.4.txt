1) Replace the period character "." within each string in another character i.e. "-" minus sign.

x=c('data.science.in.R','machine.learning.in.R')
gsub("[.]", "-", x)

Answer: [1] "data-science-in-R"     "machine-learning-in-R"

2) Append again with "-" minus sign character at the start of the each string and finally concatenate all the string within the vector to form a final single string and assigning it the object.

x<-c('data.science.in.R','machine.learning.in.R')
paste(x,sep ="-",collapse =" ")

Answer: [2] "data.science.in.R machine.learning.in.R"
